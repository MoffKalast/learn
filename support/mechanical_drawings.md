## Mechanical Drawings
Here are some mechanical drawings that are of use for persons who want to add to the Magni robot base as they form their own unique product or project.

### Top Plate

The top plate of the magni is a very thick plate that firmly attaches to the base using 4 beveled head screws in order to provide a flat, sturdy top plate for mounting of devices of your choosing.

Here is a drawing that shows the dimensions used for the plate as well as some basic Magni specifications so you know the height of the plate and it's position relative to the wheels on the robot.
