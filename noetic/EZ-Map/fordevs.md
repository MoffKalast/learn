## Views and Widgets

EZ-Map at it's core consists of a system that loads custom plugins, which in turn add the main functionality and allow for high customisability.

## Remote Control

Joysticks for remote control are always present and offer a few different modes:

- **Portrait Arrows**: tap arrows to move the robot in a specific direction, much like Robot Commander

- **Portrait Joystick**: drive the robot using one single joystick (must be enabled in the settings menu)

- **Landscape Mode**: Allows driving with two joysticks, one for forward movement and one for turning (as seen on picture above)

- **Desktop Mode**: available on non-touchscreen systems with a physical keyboard and allows driving with WASD or IJKL keys

## Widget Plugins

Plugins usually fit into two groups: windows or widgets. Widgets appear as buttons on the screen and usually open a specific menu or run an action.

The same installed widgets will also appear on the portrait mode button bar.
