#### &uarr;[top](https://ubiquityrobotics.github.io/learn/)

ROS has a wide user bases and there are lots of resources to learn how to program with it.

### ROS Texts

Some of the texts that are widely acknowledged as excellent include:

[A Gentle introduction to ROS](https://cse.sc.edu/~jokane/agitr/ ) - This is an excellent text that is provided free online 

[Programming Robots with ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/Books/Programming_Robots_with_ROS) - Was written by many of the original developers of ROS

[ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) - A free online resource

### Online lecture courses
In addition there are a number of lecture series on ROS some that can be found online include:

[Programming for Robotics - ROS](http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html) From ETH Zurich

[Introduction to Robotics](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yehoshr1/89-685/) From Bar-Ilan University

### Starter Code

For those of you who want to dive straight in to code - we've provided a couple of example projects they are a little more complicated than "hello world" but only a little, they also provide a lot of the basic infrastructure you need to create a starting point.

[Move demo](https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/demos/tree/master/move_demo) This code simply moves the robot. It includes all the bindings to external services that both navigate and drive the robot.

[The Fiducial Follow App](https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/demos/tree/master/fiducial_follow) This code follows a fiducial. It contains the bindings that are needed to do useful work with Fiducials.

If you have issues conisder posting your question to [forum.ubiquityrobotics.com] other than that - we hope you have much success developing your applications with Magni.
