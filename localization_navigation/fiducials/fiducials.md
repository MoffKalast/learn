# Fiducial-Based Localization

In this section, we describe our approach to fiducial-based localization.
This is one of the ways in which a robot's position in the `world` can
be determined.  For a discussion of other approaches, see the
[Navigation and Localization Overview](../overview/overview.md).

This document assumes that you are running the software on a Ubiquity
Robotics robot base, using the supplied Raspberry Pi camera.
