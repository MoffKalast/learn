# Autonomous Navigation

In order to have a robot be able to respond to a command such as
`go to the kitchen`, we must address the following three requirements:

* The current position of the robot must be known. This is refered to as
  *localization*
* We must have some representation of our environment, so that a path
  can be planned from the robot's current position to the destination.
* There is some way to deal with unexpected obstacles on the way.

Much literature has been published on meeting these requirements, and
there is plenty of opensource ROS software available.  We provide an overview
of the approaches below, and then discuss the approach used in the
*Ubiquity Robotics Approach*

## Localization

## Path Planning

## Obstacle Avoidance

## The Ubuiquity Robotics Approach

### Fiducial-Based Localization

### Move Basic
