# Preface: Ubiquity Robotics' Robot Development Platform

**The goal of this guide is to get web, mobile, and maker developers using ROS (the Robot Operating System) via the Ubiquity Robotics development platforms.** We hope you will see the amazing possibilities and opportunities, dive in and never look back.

## What are the Ubiquity Development Platforms and What Do they Do?

Magni and Loki are hardware platforms and mobile bases. When powered by ROS software, these platforms can handle vision, localization, communication and mobility. Magni is the heavy weight platform capable of moving payloads as high as 100kg. It can autonomously move anything on top of it to wherever that item needs to go, avoiding obstacles along the way.

Loki is great for the development environment. Its software compatibility with Magni saves money, time, and effort during the development phase. *{Wayne: Loki currently does not have ledge detectors.  Loki really has no business on the desktop.  It is designed to live on the floor.}*

A mobile base is the heart of a modular/interoperability model of robotics. Without a shared base, parts such as robotic arms, sensors, and other tools could not find or get to their location. Even at their desired location, each would require an independent “brain” to know what to do, which would in turn require interpretation between each of the components.

If you want to build anything from laundryBots to a fleet of waiters for hire, Ubiquity's hardware, driven by the open source ROS software, is an ideal starting point for any developer transitioning into robotics.

## What is ROS?

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. In ROS, the intense research and expertise of engineers, computer scientists and more have been distilled into ready-to-use development environments and function calls. ROS has simplified the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of tasks.

## Start Dreaming!

When a mobile base can move wherever it is needed without running into obstacles, lots of opportunities arise.

Whether you are delivering coffee, transporting people, or moving industrial equipment, progress starts with knowing where you are, what your goal is, and how to achieve it while avoiding obstacles. Magni and Loki make learning these core concepts affordable, accessible and fun.
