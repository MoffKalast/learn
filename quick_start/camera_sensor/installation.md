The easiest way to install the camera is to remove the the Pi, attache the camera to the mounting bracket, and thread the cable through the slot holding the camera.

Then attach the cable to the Pi, the 'blue' part of the cable faces toward the USB ports

 Then reinstall the Pi, making sure the pins are aligned correctly. (Mis-aligned pins will cause the Pi to fail!)
