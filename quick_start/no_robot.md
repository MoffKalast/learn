# If You Don't Have Your Robot Yet

The UbiquityRobotics robots are controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3.
If you have one of these (especially if you have a camera for it) There are numerous things you can profitably do by running the Ubiquity software on your Pi.

* You can install the Ubiquity software image.
* You can connect to your workstation.
* You can install our virtual machine on your workstation,  
--or--
* You can set up ROS on your workstation.
* You can connect the Pi to your network.
* You can print fiducials and post them.
* You can recognize fiducials using the camera.
* You can follow the Pi using Rviz and rqt_image_view on your workstation.
