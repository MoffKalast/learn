## Using Robot Commander
* Press any arrow to move the robot. To keep the robot moving, keep pressing or clicking.
* Tap the Microphone to use speech.
* Say, "forward", "back", or other commands. There is a list of commands in the menu in the top right corner of the screen. The forward and back and the rotation commands allow you to say how far, for example "forward 3 feet" or "back 5 meters", or "rotate right 90 degrees".
* Where there is a lot of competing speech, you can turn on the "wake word" feature, in Settings. When it is on, all commands must be prefaced by the wake word, "robot".
