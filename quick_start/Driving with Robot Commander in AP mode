How to drive with a Smartphone or workstation using Robot Commander in AP mode 

1. Turn the robot on.
2. If you haven't, install the Robot Commander app on your Android phone.  (link)
3. Allow at least 3 minutes after turning the robot on. On the phone, in Settings/WiFi, connect to the UbiquityRobot network.  The password is robotseverywhere. 
4. On a smartphone, start the Robot Commander app.  On a workstation, fetch the Robot Commander page.
5. Enter the address "ws://10.42.0.1:9090" in the space to the left of the Connect button.
6. Press the Connect button. You will hear "Connected" and the button will now read "Disconnect".
7. To use Robot Commander:
* Press any arrow to move the robot. To keep the robot moving, keep pressing.
* Tap the Microphone to use speech.
* Say, "forward", "back", or other commands. There is a list of commands in the menu in the top right corner of the screen. The forward and back and the rotation commands allow you to say how far, for example "forward 3 feet" or "back 5 meters", or "rotate right 90 degrees".
* In environments where there is a lot of competing speech, you can turn on the "wake word" feature, in Settings. When it is on, all commands must be prefaced by the wake word, "robot".
