Teleoperation allows you to manually control the robot. Keyboard and joystick are the two primary ways to do this. Before we experiment with these two methods, we need to set up Magni to receive our commands.

On Magni run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch magni_bringup magni.launch
{% endhighlight %}

Now it’s ready to receive commands from the workstation.

## Keyboard

To use the keyboard for teleoperation, run the following on the workstation:

{% highlight sh %}
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py 
{% endhighlight %}

The terminal prints out the keyboard commands for manually controlling Magni’s position, rotation and more.

## Joystick

By default Magni works with Logitech joysticks. See the spearate pages on the Logitech Controller. The controller is attached to the robot's computer, so you can teleop without a workstation.
