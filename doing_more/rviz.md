# Visualize with rviz

#### &uarr;[top](/learn/index.md) - - - &uarr;[up](ix_doing_more) - - -

rviz (ROS visualization) is a 3D visualizer for displaying sensor data and state information from ROS. It can show the robot in space as well as graph practically any robot parameter.

To start rviz, type on the workstation command line:

  `rviz`

RViz is highly configurable so its possible to save a previous configuration and reuse it again and again.

<insert some description of the configuration file, and how to make use of it and insert a link to a previously utilized configuration file>
