## The Feature That was explained here has been Removed
We had been thinking about a feature that was described on this page to follow fiducials on the floor when this page was written.

At this time we are taking this page with this experimental mode offline while we work out if we are to in the future support a mode that follows floor fiducials.

You may contact us on the forum if you have any questions.
