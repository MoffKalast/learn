Set up fiducials so you can set waypoints and goals

Print fiducials using ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each fiducial embodies a number.  It doesn't matter what numbers you choose, as long as they are all different.

Post the fiducials on the walls of the area in which the robot will be operating, where the robots view is not obstructed.  Space them so two or more will be in the robot's field of view, at least most of the time.

That's all you need to do!
