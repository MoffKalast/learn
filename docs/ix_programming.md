##	Programming Your Robot

#### &uarr;[top](https://ubiquityrobotics.github.io/learn/)

ROS has a wide user bases and there are lots of resources to learn how to program with it.

### ROS Texts

Some of the texts that are widely acknowledged as excellent include:

[A Gentle introduction to ROS](https://cse.sc.edu/~jokane/agitr/ ) - Free online textbook style guide

[Programming Robots with ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/Books/Programming_Robots_with_ROS) - Was written by many of the original developers of ROS

[ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) - An online resource maintained by The Open Source Robotics Foundation

### Online lecture courses
In addition there are a number of lecture series on ROS some that can be found online include:

[Programming for Robotics - ROS](http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html) From ETH Zurich

[Introduction to Robotics](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yehoshr1/89-685/) From Bar-Ilan University

### Starter Code

For those of you who want to dive straight in to code - we've provided a couple of example projects. They also provide a lot of the basic infrastructure you need and create a starting point.

##### Fiducial Follow
This code follows a fiducial marker. [Follow this link to learn how Fiducial Follow works](https://ubiquityrobotics.github.io/learn/fiducial_follow_app). The app itself contains the bindings that are needed to do useful work with fiducials. [Click here for The Fiducial Follow App code repository ](https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/demos/tree/master/fiducial_follow) 

##### Move Demo
[Move demo](https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/demos/tree/master/move_demo) This code simply moves the robot. It includes all the bindings to external services that both navigate and drive the robot.

### Good Luck!!

If you have issues conisder posting your question to [forum.ubiquityrobotics.com](https://forum.ubiquityrobotics.com/) other than that - we hope you have much success developing your applications with Magni.
